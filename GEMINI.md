# Eatsbits Guidelines & AI Agent Rules

## CRITICAL POLICY: NO AUTOMATED TESTS OR BACKGROUND GPU/AUDIO PROCESSES

### 1. Absolute Prohibition of Automated Testing
- **Under NO circumstances should automated tests be run.**
- The user actively tests updates manually. Test execution is strictly reserved for the user unless explicitly and manually requested (e.g., "run tests now").
- Strictly prohibited from running automatically:
  - Unit test binaries (	est_*.exe, *test*.exe, *diag*.exe).
  - Test suites and test runners (ctest, 
inja test).
  - Build script test flags (.\build.ps1 -Test).
  - Smoke tests or headless verification flags (--smoke-test, --headless).
  - Ad-hoc diagnostic or verification binaries.
- Do NOT run tests under the guise of "debugging", "diagnostics", or "verifying changes".

### 2. Windows System Stability and Background Process Safety
- Executables in this repository initialize hardware graphics contexts (WebGPU / wgpu-native, DirectX, Vulkan, OpenGL) or real-time audio threads. Running them in subshells or pushing them to background tasks hangs the process, leaks GPU/audio contexts, and stalls Windows and Antigravity IDE.
- If the user explicitly requests compiling or building, ALWAYS specify flags that inhibit running or launching:
  - When running uild.ps1: pass -NoRun.
  - When running cmake --build: only target specified non-test targets, and never execute the resulting binary.
